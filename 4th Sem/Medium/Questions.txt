 1. find the second largest element in an array
 2. array reversal
 3. string reversal
 4. array rotation (right)
 5. array rotation (left)
 6. find the missing number in the series from 1 to n
    sample input : [1,2,4,5]
    output       : 3
 7. array rotation by n times
 8. find the duplicate elements in an array
    sample input : {1,2,2,3,3,4}
    output       : {2,3}
 9. in an array, return the first element which appears more than
    once.
    sample input : {1,2,2,3,4}
    output       : 2
10. find the superior elements in the array
    (element which is greater than all of its right elements)
    sample input : {16,17,4,3,5,2}
    output       : 17,5,2
11. find the count of repeating elements in the array
    sample input : {10,5,2,3,5,1}
    sample output: 2 (5 repeats 2 times)
12. merge 2 sorted arrays
    sample input : {1,2,3} {4,5,6}
    sample output : {1,2,3,4,5,6}
